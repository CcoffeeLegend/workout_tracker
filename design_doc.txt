This program is intended to be a workout routine tracker.

Minimum Specifications:
1. User information tracking across logins(login information, routine chart)
2. menu for user to select functional options (start a workout, quit, add exercise, remove exercise, change sets and reps)
3. if new user, extra steps for creation of one upon registration. existing users straight to menu

Final Specification:
1. Create a GUI

Optional Specifications (Updated):

1. Provide recommended rep and set ranges, adjusted for routine status set as "Bodybuilding" or "Powerlifting"
   - Users select a training goal (e.g., "bodybuilding" or "powerlifting")
   - Based on selection, the app suggests default rep/set ranges when adding exercises
     (e.g., 3x10 for bodybuilding, 5x5 for powerlifting)

2. Multiple routines conceptualized as workout days (e.g., Chest Day, Leg Day, etc.)
   - Instead of a single routine list, users can create multiple named routines
   - Each named routine (e.g., "Push Day", "Leg Day") is a list of exercises
   - Data structure changes from a flat list to a dictionary of routine names
   - Users choose or create a routine (day) before adding/viewing/starting workouts

3. Toggle auto-increment weight
   - Already implemented
   - Each exercise includes an "auto_increment" value (e.g., +5 lbs)
   - After successfully completing a workout, weights increase by the set amount

4. Add lb/kg toggle per user
   - During user registration, prompt user to choose weight unit preference ("lbs" or "kg")
   - Store this preference in their profile
   - All weight inputs and displays use the selected unit
   - Allow users to toggle between lbs/kg in a "User Settings" menu

5. User Settings menu
   - New menu option called "User Settings"
   - Centralized location for preferences like:
     - Changing password
     - Switching between lb/kg
     - Changing training goal (e.g., bodybuilding, powerlifting)
   - Keeps the main menu clean and functional options distinct from profile configuration


Intended New User UX:
Startup
prompted if you want to login, or create a new account
enter create a new account
type username
type password
user is brought to initial routine setup
prompted for exercise name
set count
rep count
set 1 weight
set 2 weight
etc.
Ask if add more or head to menu
if add more, prompt for next exercise name, set, rep, etc.
else send to menu
menu has these options: start workout, add exercise, remove exercise, quit
add, remove, and quit are self-explanatory
start workout should begin the workout, showing the user each exercise goals (name, set, rep, weight), and prompting the user to input done to advance to the next exercise.
once all exercises are done, send user back to menu
